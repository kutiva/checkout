- Engineering Tech Spec â€“ Phase I

The purpose of the project is to  possibilit a transaction with Mpesa service to support B2C and C2B.


 The goals are, Enable customers to make payments using Mpesa API in the B2C model, Enable businesses to make payments to customers using Mpesa API in the B2C model, and Allow businesses to receive payments using Mpesa API in the C2B model.

To achieve all the defined goals, we need to divide the problem into small problems, and we will increase the complexity.

Facilitating Customer Payments (B2C Model):

The first objective is to enable customers to use the Mpesa API to make payments. This involves integrating Mpesa's payment functionality into the checkout process to allow customers to pay for products or services seamlessly.
Enabling Business Payments to Customers (B2C Model):
Business Payment Receipt (C2B):

Set up a mechanism for businesses to receive payments from customers using your API. Ensure that your API can handle incoming payment requests from customers and securely process these transactions.
Security and Compliance:

Implement robust security measures, including encryption, authentication, and authorization, to safeguard sensitive payment data. Also, ensure compliance with any regulatory requirements related to financial transactions.
Testing and Quality Assurance:

Thoroughly test your API to ensure it functions correctly in various scenarios. This includes testing for edge cases, error handling, and performance under different loads.
Documentation:

Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for your API. This should include usage guidelines, API endpoints, request/response examples, and any required authentication details.
Deployment and Scalability:

Deploy your API to a production environment and configure it for scalability. Consider load balancing and auto-scaling to handle increased traffic as your service gains popularity.
Monitoring and Maintenance:

Implement monitoring tools to track the performance and health of your API. Set up alerts for critical issues and establish a maintenance plan to address bugs and updates.
User Support and Training:

Offer customer support for users of your API and provide training materials to help them integrate with your service effectively.
Promotion and Adoption:

Promote your API to potential users, whether they are businesses or customers, to encourage adoption and usage.
